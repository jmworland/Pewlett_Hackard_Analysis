# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project given to us by our manager was to mainly to organize our employee demographic data into dynamic databases that will allow in depth analysis along many different lines. Once we updated the database we were then tasked with investigating how many employees were reaching retirement age and how many employees were eligible for the mentoring program. We completed this analysis creating several tables that show complex lists with parsed out employee information and also simple lists that show total number of employees per job title that will be retiring. 

## Results
The results are extreme. 
•	There is a large amount of retiring workforce that will seriously affect the company if we do not take drastic efforts to prepare. [Retiring by Titles]
•	Majority of retiring employees are senior staff and senior engineers. We also have two managers that are retiring. 
•	Small number of employees are eligible for mentoring program compared to number of retiring. [Mentorship Eligibility]
•	Majority of our mentees are in regular staff and engineering levels. 

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

We are looking at over 90,000 employees retiring. There is a good opportunity with that many people retiring we will be able to address redundancies in jobs. With that being said, we will not likely have to replace all positions. We will need to focus on the manager roles and senior level roles. Thankfully, a majority of our mentees are in roles that are able to be promoted to senior levels. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? 

We have more than enough retirement-ready employees to mentor everyone that is eligible for the program. 

Two other queries that will be beneficial are the salaries query and the employees per department query. The salaries query will show us how much money the company will have to redistribute to new roles/employees and/or be able to save. The employees per department query will show how many employees will remain in each department once the retirees leave. This will help the company to know which departmental replacements will be a priority to make sure the department can still function. 

This concludes the analysis and report. If there is any more information needed, please reach out and we will be glad to provide more analysis.
